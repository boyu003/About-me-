About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Boyu Zhang, an analytical and results-driven professional with a strong foundation in economics, data analysis, and business strategy. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics (STEM) at the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, and I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with a minor in Business Management from Boston University, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.9/4.0 GPA.

My passion lies in leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex economic and business challenges, making me a strong fit for roles in economic consulting. I thrive in environments where I can apply my expertise in quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to help organizations optimize their operations and achieve their goals.

Professional Experience

I have hands-on experience in data analysis, economic modeling, and strategic consulting, gained through internships and academic projects. At AVIVA-COFCO Life Insurance, I developed a cost and market share dashboard in Tableau, automated SQL ETL pipelines, and forecasted market conditions for insurance products, improving operational efficiency by 20%. This experience allowed me to collaborate across departments, present insights to leadership, and ensure compliance with regulatory standardsâ€”skills that are directly transferable to economic consulting.

During my internship at Castleton Law Group, I conducted quantitative assessments of appraisals in complex legal cases involving estates and probates, honing my ability to analyze financial data and communicate findings effectively to stakeholders. This experience strengthened my ability to work in high-stakes, detail-oriented environmentsâ€”key qualities for economic consulting.

Software: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), JMP, Abacus Law
Relevant Projects

Here are some of the projects that demonstrate my ability to apply economic and analytical skills to real-world problems:

Diversification of Risk Preference Analysis: Quantified individual risk preferences using OLS regression models and analyzed data from the Survey of Consumer Finance (22,975 observations). I led a team of four to deliver insights on institutional investorsâ€™ risk-taking behavior, providing critical input for monetary policy evaluation.
The Impact of Female Education on Childbirth: Improved economic analysis precision by 70% through advanced regression techniques and multicollinearity checks, increasing the model's predictive power by 9%. This project showcased my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
Geospatial Analysis for Uber Pickup Patterns: Engineered 18.8 million Uber pickup records using Python, applied clustering algorithms to identify demand hotspots, and created interactive geospatial visualizations. This project demonstrated my ability to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiencyâ€”skills highly relevant to economic consulting.
Deep Learning for Business Applications: Explored advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Deep Learning models, to solve business problems such as customer segmentation and predictive analytics. These techniques allowed me to uncover hidden patterns in large datasets and improve decision-making processes.
Why Economic Consulting?

I am passionate about using data, economic theory, and machine learning to solve real-world business challenges. Economic consulting excites me because it combines quantitative rigor with strategic thinking to help organizations make informed decisions. Whether it's analyzing market trends, assessing risk, or optimizing operations, I enjoy the process of turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.

Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis, exploring film production, and going on hikes. These activities keep me balanced and inspire creativity, which I bring into my professional life.
